# EarthApp

## Overview:
This project involves developing an iOS app using Apple Vision Pro framework. The app aims to provide users with information about Earth and a 3D model visualization. It utilizes SwiftUI for the user interface and RealityKit/SceneKit for the 3D visualization.

## Skills Utilized:
- **Swift Programming Language:** The app is developed using Swift, Apple's programming language for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS development.
- **SwiftUI:** SwiftUI is used to create the user interface of the app, including views, buttons, and navigation.
- **RealityKit/SceneKit:** The app leverages RealityKit and SceneKit to create and render 3D models within the app.
- **Xcode:** Xcode is the integrated development environment (IDE) used for iOS app development. It provides tools for coding, debugging, and testing iOS apps.
- **GitHub:** The project is hosted on GitHub, a platform for version control and collaboration. GitHub is used for managing the project's source code and collaborating with other developers.

## Features:
1. **Learn about Earth:** Users can access information about Earth, including facts and descriptions.
2. **3D Model Visualization:** The app provides a 3D visualization of Earth using RealityKit/SceneKit.
3. **Navigation:** Users can navigate between different screens using buttons and gestures.
4. **GitHub Repository:** The project is hosted on GitHub, allowing for version control, collaboration, and open-source contributions.

## Usage:
1. Clone or download the project from the GitHub repository.
2. Open the project in Xcode.
3. Build and run the app on a simulator or a physical device to explore its features.

## In Progress:
- **Adding Quiz Feature:**  currently working on implementing a quiz feature to test users' knowledge about Earth.
